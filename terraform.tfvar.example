# Notes:
# - Update ami_id with the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI for us-west-2
# - Choose instance_type based on your workload requirements
# - Place one instance in both us-west-2a and us-west-2b to show instance's sharing efs
# - Use SSM to securely access your ec2 instances

# Example AMI IDs (update with current ones):
